# Usage

The Matlab script afdm_modem.m generates an AFDM signal sampled at Nyquist rate via the basic IDAFT modulator and demodulates it after WGN addition. 
It returns the BER and the input/output constellation of the random transmitted/received data.     
It is an AFDM modem that can be used to obtain basic performance metrics such as BER/EVM vs SNR, PAPR, OOBE, and so on, or to test some algorithms by adding your own code.  

# To use the python code:

Run the code on Matlab. 

# Requirements

This code has been generated using Matlab 16, but any versions (pre and post Matlab 16) should run the script.
